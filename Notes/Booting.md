** Booting:

Booting a system is the process of starting up a computer and loading the operating system into memory so that the computer becomes operational. The boot process can be divided into several steps, which generally occur in this order:

1. Power-On Self Test (POST)
When the computer is powered on or restarted, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) firmware is loaded from ROM.
The system performs a series of diagnostic tests to check the hardware (e.g., CPU, memory, keyboard, etc.) to ensure they are functioning correctly. This is known as the POST.
If any critical hardware components fail, the system will typically display an error message or beep in a specific pattern to indicate the issue.

2. Loading the BIOS/UEFI
Once the POST is successful, the BIOS/UEFI is responsible for initializing hardware components, configuring system settings, and checking for bootable devices.
The BIOS/UEFI loads and displays information about the hardware (e.g., CPU speed, RAM, hard drives).
It then searches for a bootable device in a specific order (e.g., hard drive, USB drive, CD/DVD).

3. Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT)
Once a bootable device is found, the BIOS/UEFI hands control over to the bootloader on that device. The bootloader is located in the MBR (for older systems) or GPT (for modern systems).
MBR is located in the first 512 bytes of the storage device.
GPT is used for newer systems, providing more advanced partitioning and support for larger drives.
The bootloader program is loaded into memory.

4. Bootloader Execution
The bootloader (e.g., GRUB for Linux, Bootmgr for Windows) is responsible for loading the operating system. It might display a menu allowing the user to select from multiple OS installations or recovery options.
The bootloader loads the kernel of the operating system into memory.
For Windows, the bootloader (NTLDR or Bootmgr) will load the Windows kernel.
For Linux, the bootloader (e.g., GRUB or LILO) will load the Linux kernel.

5. Loading the Operating System Kernel
The kernel, the core of the operating system, is loaded into memory. This is the crucial part of the boot process, where the system becomes fully operational.
The kernel initializes all hardware components, such as CPU, memory, and connected devices.
It then starts running the system's services, device drivers, and the rest of the operating system environment.

6. Initializing System Processes
Once the kernel is loaded, it starts the init process (or systemd in modern Linux systems), which is the first user-space process.
In Windows, the kernel starts system processes such as smss.exe (Session Manager), csrss.exe (Client/Server Runtime Subsystem), and winlogon.exe (Login process).

7. User Authentication
The operating system reaches the login screen where the user is prompted for authentication (username/password).
After successful authentication, the user environment (desktop, session) is loaded, and the system is ready for use.
