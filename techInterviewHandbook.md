 Tips to solve any DSA question by understanding patterns

If the input array is sorted then
 - Binary search
 - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then 
 - Backtracking

If given a tree then 
 - DFS
 - BFS

If given a graph then
 - DFS
 - BFS

If given a linked list then 
 - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
 - Stack

If must solve in-place then
 - Swap corresponding values
 - Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/ subset/options then 
 - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
 - Heap
 - QuickSelect

If asked for common strings then
 - Map
 - Trie

Else
 - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
 - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

1. CQRS
2. Clean Code.
3. SOLID Principles.
4. Clean Architecture.

 - 40 Problems on Dynamic Programming (DP), Backtracking, Hashing, Heap, Tries, and Greedy Algorithms: https://lnkd.in/dF3h-Khk

𝟮. 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: 
 - Use resources like "Strivers A2Z DSA Sheet" by Raj Vikramaditya to curate around 100 core problems.
 - https://lnkd.in/dQMGy9zF (Strivers)

𝟯. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 
 - Understand and implement them by hand. Know how they work internally to ace interview questions.

𝟰. 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 
 - Revisit problems after 3 days, a week, and 15 days. Break down solutions instead of rote memorization.
 - 3:7:15 Rule for DSA: https://lnkd.in/dW6a8wcg

𝟱. 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗯𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀:

 𝟭. 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺 (𝗠𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺) 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗼 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗮 𝗧𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁:
 
 - Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost / path / sum to reach the target.
 - Approach: Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state.
 - Generate optimal solutions for all values in the target and return the value for the target (Top-down, Bottom-up).
 - Problem List: https://lnkd.in/dqbRTeNp

𝟮. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗰𝘁 𝗪𝗮𝘆𝘀

 - Given a target find a number of distinct ways to reach the target.
 - Approach: Sum all possible ways to reach the current state.
 - Generate sum for all values in the target and return the value for the target (Top-down, Bottom-up).
 - Problem List: https://lnkd.in/dpjEQvap

𝟯. 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘀
 
 - Given a set of numbers find an optimal solution for a problem considering the current number and the best you can get from the left and right sides.
 - Approach: Find all optimal solutions for every interval and return the best possible answer.
 - Get the best from the left and right sides and add a solution for the current position.
 - Problem List: https://lnkd.in/d-RqjvB9

𝟰. 𝗗𝗣 𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀

 - General problem statement for this pattern can vary but most of the time you are given two strings where lengths of those strings are not big
 - Approach: Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in O(n^2) complexity.
 - If you are given one string s the approach may little vary
 - Problem List: https://lnkd.in/dedE5ezi

𝟱. 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴

 - The general problem statement for this pattern is forgiven situation decide whether to use or not to use the current state. So, the problem requires you to make a decision at a current state.
 - Approach: If you decide to choose the current value use the previous result where the value was ignored; vice-versa, if you decide to ignore the current value use previous result where value was used.
